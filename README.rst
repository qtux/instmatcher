instmatcher
===========
This library provides means to find an institution matching an affiliation string, a string consisting of for example a name, an address or similar information associated with the institution.
Its main features are:

1. Search for an institution by its name in a list based on `Wikidata`_ and `GeoNames`_.
2. Parse affiliation strings using `grobid`_ to retrieve the corresponding name and address.
3. Geocode the parsed data to enrich it with geographical coordinates based on `GeoNames`_.

============
Installation
============
To install instmatcher simply clone the git repository and install it using pip: ::

  git clone https://github.com/qtux/instmatcher.git
  cd instmatcher
  pip install .

===================
Basic Usage Example
===================
The ``match`` function may be used to search for a matching institution for a given affiliation string.

.. code:: python

    import instmatcher
    response = instmatcher.match('TU Berlin, Institute of Mathematics, Berlin, Germany')
    print(response)

Depending on how well `grobid`_ is trained, executing the code above will most likely print:

.. code:: python

    {'name': 'Technical University of Berlin', 'lat': '52.511944444444', 'lon': '13.326388888889',...

===========
Development
===========
In order to run the tests execute::

  python setup.py test

In order to build the documentation install the required packages ::

  pip install .[docs]

and use the Makefile in the **docs** folder to build the documentation.

===========
Attribution
===========
1. The list of `institutions`_ is queried from `Wikidata`_ (available under `CC0`_).
2. The list of `institutions`_ is enhanced using the `reverse-geocoder`_ library which contains `GeoNames`_ data (available under `CC BY 3.0`_).
3. The list of `cities`_ and the list of `countries`_ are taken from `GeoNames`_  (available under `CC BY 3.0`_).
